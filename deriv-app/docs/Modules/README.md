# Creating new packages

In order to create and add a new package to this project/repo, please follow the guideline below:

1. Make sure your new package name is prefixed with `deriv-`.
2. Make sure the Webpack config has `IS_RELEASE` flag, as well as conditional source-maps based on "if IS_RELEASE".
