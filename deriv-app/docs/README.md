# Architecture and general philosophy of the project

## Brief
This project contains different dependency libraries and different packages used by the Core package (`deriv-core`).

Each package in the `packages` folder is a dependency that eventually up to Core (the main app).

There are 2 types of dependencies:

1. Reusable code/libraries - These are packages that are meant to be loaded anywhere for use, and they enhance the application and/or development. At the time of writing, this includes: `deriv-components`, `deriv-shared`, `deriv-p2p`, `deriv-translations`.
2. Platforms/Modules/Apps - These can be viewed as applications of their own. According to business logic, these are different domains/sections, and most likely have their own route. At the time of writing, this includes: `deriv-bot`, `deriv-trader`.

The `deriv-core` package is the "app instance". It contains singleton services (such as the WS, and base/common stores), as well as singleton UI components (header, footer, modals management, cashier).

_Hint: In order to simply build (without tests) type 1 dependencies, use the command `npm run build:travis` from the root of the package. In order to build type 2 dependencies, in the same manner, use `npm run build:local`._

To illustrate the structure above (with packages that exist at the time of writing, it would look something like below:
