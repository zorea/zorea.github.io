/**
Below are the list of events we can register to listen to :
 
-bot.running : Emitted in trade/index.js, in old Binary Bot this is only used
to set the label to is running.

-bot.stop: Bot was stopped by the user

-bot.contract: Called in OpenContract.js, object consisting of
accountID and a proposal_open_contract response, this will
be emitted on each POC message from the server.

-bot.info: Emitted in trade/Balance.js, it announces account ID and balance,
we don't need this in DerivBot. Can also be emitted during running
contract, it then announces an object consisting of accountID,
total_runs, transaction_ids, contract_type, and buy_price.

-contract.status:  First emitted in trade/Purchase.js with an idea that's more
of a flag e.g. contract_purchase_sent (when buy was sent to
API, or contract_purchase_recieved (when buy was acknowledged
by API), or contract.sold (when a contract was sold/expired).

-contract.settled: this event was emitted to initiate a
settlement of a contract, i.e. it would call proposal_open_contract to retrieve
latest values for contract, not required atm by DerivBot

-googledrive.authorise : event to start auturize google flow

-ui.log.success: UI Notifications

-ui.log.error: UI errors

-ui.log.warn: UI warning

-Notify: Server Notifications

-Error : Server errors
